    - name: "Jed Gresham"
      position: "Puppet, Director of Product Management"
      content: "It was great to work with Tara as someone newer to the Product Management discipline. She's always eager to try new things and had no problem asking questions. She took on some pretty big projects early on, and her work product was always impressive. When discussing her deliverables it became apparent to me that she's really comfortable winding her way throughout an organization to learn more for different teams and individuals, and ultimately overachieve on outcomes without needing a ton of direction up front. That was really refreshing and it felt like her experiential growth came very quickly. I trust Tara and know she would be a great addition to a team and would make quick work of onboarding and learning new concepts."

    - name: "Dave Shanley"
      position: "Jama Software, VP of Product Marketing"
      content: "I highly recommend Tara. Her strong sense of ownership, high level of organization, and desire to continually learn meant that she meshed seamlessly with our deeply experienced Product Marketing team and ran independently with several significant initiatives while also supporting the efforts of the larger group.
In her time with us, Tara owned messaging on the Customer Review sites (like Capterra, G2 Crowd) and developing an incentive program to yield more reviews in a scrappy, low-cost way. In addition, she launched add-ons for our flagship product, wrote several blog posts including all the background research, and wrapped up positioning for a significant area of our product.
Tara was so well liked internally that the business development team stole her away to run with some of their projects.

Tara brings a hard-to-find mix of market awareness, technical knowledge, and a desire to learn along with a can-do attitude and perseverance. She's a delight to work with and would be a great addition to any team.

      position: "IBM, Sales Director"
      content: "In my capacity as the WW Sales Director at IBM Microelectronics, I interacted with Tara regularly as she provided Product Management support for several of my top ten clients. She was responsible for working with customers to ensure new products smoothly transitioned into high volume production. Tara demonstrated strong product and project management skills and leveraged her leadership capabilities to ensure that issues were quickly resolved. She has a pleasant personality and used it to her advantage to team with cross functional groups and put strategies in place that contemplated various scenarios and identified paths to problem resolution. As a mentor, I have witnessed Tara grow from her early years in IBM to a strong and confident individual with a vision for her career. I am confident that Tara will succeed in her future endeavors and I highly recommend her for any opportunities she wants to pursue."
